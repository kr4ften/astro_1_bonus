1)
Stellar initial mass: 1.69
Effective temperature: approx 6200 K
Luminosity: LogL = 0.5  =>   L/L_sun = 3.16  =>  L = 1.216 * 10^27 W/m^2

2)
Stellar initial mass: 2.45
Effective temperature: approx 6100 K (logTe = 3.71)
Luminosity: LogL = 0.575    =>  L/L_sun = 3.758     => L = 1.4461 * 10^27 W/m^2

3)
More stars have deviated from the main sequence, the turnoff point has moved lower in temperature.

Reason: This cluster is significantly older, thus more stars have expended their fuel and turned into red giants.

4)
By plotting 10.3e9y, 11.0e9y and 9.0e9y

10.3e9y aligns best with our sun. at the turn off point the stars have Mini of about 1 solar mass

5)
Plotted as 4.69e9_vs_10.3e9y.png

6)
More hot stars remain on the main sequence than in the isochrone with lower metallicity

The cluster would appear bluer if we were to observe it with our eyes.

7)
Stellar initial mass: 1.69
Effective temperature: approx 8050 K
Luminosity: LogL = 0.82  =>   L/L_sun = 6.607  =>  L = 2.542 * 10^27 W/m^2

8a)
The star with lower metallicity will spend longer on the main sequence, it will have a longer life-span.

8b)
